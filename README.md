## R-CNN for object detection 

### Objective:
Implementation of an coustomized motion and object detection (Computer Vision) of an arbitrary mobile object using R-CNN (Deep Learning).
The object (remote controlled car) should be recognised in individual images and in videos in order to track its movement.

### Part 1: Generation of data
- created a custom dataset with images and bounding box labels of the remote controlled car (see folder [base_data](https://github.com/nickjust/RCNN_object_detection/tree/main/base_data)) 
- labelimg was used to annotate the bounding boxes and for automated saving of the coordinates in .xml format ([labelimg](https://github.com/nickjust/RCNN_object_detection/tree/main/labelimg))
